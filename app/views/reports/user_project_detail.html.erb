<h1>User Detail Report</h1>

<p>You searched for time activity for <%= @user.name %> between <%= localize(@start_date, format: :long) %>
  and  <%= localize(@end_date, format: :long) %>. During this period, <%= @user.name %> worked <%= pluralize(@total_hours, 'hour') %>.</p>

<blockquote>Note: Because I had in mind a consumer focus management tool, this report is a little more useful,
  breaking down the hours by projects. The methods I used were VERY primitive and should be replaced by nice
  queries and group by transformations of the data but I was out of time to think that through.
